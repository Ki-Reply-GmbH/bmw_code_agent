"Resolving Merge Conflict in 'hello.txt' and Improving Java Code Quality"
**Background/Context**: This PR is necessary due to the need to resolve a merge conflict and improve code quality. The merge conflict arose from simultaneous changes made to the same file, 'hello.txt'. The code quality improvements were identified by a code quality agent in several Java files.

**Feature Description**: The feature being added is the resolution of a merge conflict in 'hello.txt'. The problem being solved is the improvement of code quality in several Java files.

**Solution**: The merge conflict was resolved by combining changes in 'hello.txt'. Code quality was improved by refactoring the Java files to use the List interface instead of the ArrayList implementation, adding a private constructor to utility classes, fixing equality checks, making classes final, and handling NullPointerExceptions.

**Impact**: The changes affect 'hello.txt' and several Java files in the project.

**Summary of Changes**: 
1. Merge Agent Commit: Resolved a merge conflict in 'hello.txt' by combining changes.
2. Code Quality Agent Commit: Refactored several Java files to improve code quality. Changes include using the List interface instead of ArrayList, adding private constructors to utility classes, fixing equality checks, making classes final, and handling NullPointerExceptions.
