"Resolving Merge Conflict in 'hello.txt' and Improving Code Quality in 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'"
**Background/Context**: This PR is necessary due to the need to resolve a merge conflict and improve code quality in several Java files. The merge conflict arose from simultaneous changes made to the 'hello.txt' file. The code quality improvements were identified by a code quality agent and pertain to best practices and robustness in Java programming.

**Feature Description**: The feature being added is the resolution of a merge conflict in 'hello.txt'. The problems being solved are various code quality issues in 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'.

**Solution**: The merge conflict was resolved by combining changes in 'hello.txt'. The code quality issues were addressed by refactoring 'File1.java' for best practices and robustness, fixing logic and adding a private constructor in 'File2.java', and making 'File3.java' final and handling NullPointerException.

**Impact**: The changes affect 'hello.txt', 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'. The resolution of the merge conflict in 'hello.txt' ensures smooth collaboration and version control. The code quality improvements in the Java files enhance the robustness, maintainability, and readability of the code.

**Summary of Changes**: 
1. 'hello.txt': Resolved merge conflict by combining changes.
2. 'File1.java': Refactored for best practices and robustness. Addressed issues such as classes not belonging to a named package and utility classes having non-private constructors.
3. 'File2.java': Fixed logic and added a private constructor. Addressed issues such as assignments in operands and classes not belonging to a named package.
4. 'File3.java': Made the class final and handled NullPointerException. Addressed issues such as classes not belonging to a named package and utility classes having non-private constructors.
