"Resolve Merge Conflict in 'hello.txt' and Improve Code Quality in 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'"
**Background/Context**: This PR is necessary due to the need to resolve a merge conflict and improve code quality in several Java files. The merge conflict arose in the 'hello.txt' file, and the code quality issues were identified in 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'.

**Feature Description**: The feature being added is the resolution of a merge conflict in 'hello.txt'. The problems being solved are various code quality issues in the Java files, including the lack of named packages, utility classes with non-private constructors, assignments in operands, and the use of implementation types like 'ArrayList'.

**Solution**: The merge conflict was resolved by combining line changes in 'hello.txt'. The code quality issues were addressed by refactoring 'File1.java', fixing the equality check and adding a private constructor in 'File2.java', and handling a null pointer and adding a private constructor in 'File3.java'.

**Impact**: The changes affect 'hello.txt' and the three Java files, 'File1.java', 'File2.java', and 'File3.java'. These changes will improve the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the code in these files.

**Summary of Changes**: 
1. 'hello.txt': Resolved a merge conflict by combining line changes.
2. 'File1.java': Refactored for code quality improvements.
3. 'File2.java': Fixed an equality check and added a private constructor.
4. 'File3.java': Handled a null pointer and added a private constructor.
