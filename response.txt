"Resolve Merge Conflict in 'hello.txt' and Improve Code Quality in Two Python Files"
**Background/Context**: This PR is necessary to resolve a merge conflict and improve code quality. The merge conflict arose in the file 'hello.txt', and the code quality improvements were made in two Python files.

**Feature Description**: The feature being added is the resolution of a merge conflict in 'hello.txt'. The problem being solved is the poor readability of arithmetic operations and the lack of a newline at the end of two Python files.

**Solution**: The merge conflict was resolved by combining line changes in 'hello.txt'. The code quality was improved by refactoring arithmetic operations for better readability and ensuring a newline at the end of the Python files.

**Impact**: The changes affect 'hello.txt' and two Python files located in the '.tmp' directory of the 'bmw_code_agent' project.

**Summary of Changes**: 
1. Merge Agent Commit: Resolved a merge conflict in 'hello.txt' by combining line changes.
2. Code Quality Agent Commit: Improved the readability of arithmetic operations and ensured a newline at the end of 'poor_quality1.py' and 'poor_quality2.py'.
