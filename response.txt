### Background/Context
This pull request appears to be a combination of efforts to resolve a merge conflict and improve code quality. The merge conflict resolution is a necessary step to ensure that changes from different contributors are integrated smoothly. The code quality improvements likely arose from a standard review process aimed at maintaining a clean and readable codebase.

### Feature Description
The PR does not introduce a new feature but focuses on two main aspects:
1. Resolving a merge conflict in a text file.
2. Refactoring code for better readability and adherence to coding standards in two Python scripts.

### Solution
1. The merge conflict was resolved by combining line changes in the file `hello.txt`.
2. Code quality improvements were made by adding spaces around operators and ensuring that there is a newline at the end of the files for `poor_quality1.py` and `poor_quality2.py`. Additionally, the result of an expression is now stored, which could be for clarity or later use.

### Impact
The changes affect:
1. The `hello.txt` file, which had a merge conflict.
2. Two Python scripts located in the `.tmp` directory of the `bmw_code_agent` project, which have been refactored for better code quality.

### Summary of Changes
- **hello.txt**: Resolved a merge conflict by combining line changes.
- **poor_quality1.py** and **poor_quality2.py**:
  - Added spaces around the '+' operator for better readability.
  - Ensured that there is a newline at the end of each file.
  - Stored the result of an expression, which may enhance code clarity or be used later in the code.
