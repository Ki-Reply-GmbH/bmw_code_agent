To resolve the merge conflict, I looked at the changes between the HEAD (current branch) and the main branch. The conflict is a result of changes made to the same line in both branches. To resolve it, I had to decide which change to keep or whether to combine the changes. Without additional context on the intended final result, I cannot automatically choose the correct resolution. However, for the purpose of this example, I will assume that we want to keep both changes and combine them into one line.
